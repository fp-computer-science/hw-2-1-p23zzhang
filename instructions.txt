--- Instructions ---

Congratulations! You were able to successfully clone the repository, and find the instructions.
Things will only get harder from here!

For this assignment, we will keep things simple. Create a new file in the repository
called all_about_me.txt. In the file, on the first line, type your first and last name.
On the next line, type something that you are looking forward to learning about in this class this semester.
On the third line, type something about you that you would like me to know.
Once you have done that, commit your changes to the repository, and push your changes to GitHub.
